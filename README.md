##Overview

This is the code for gender classification on the basis of small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train by using below classifiers:-

1. Decision Tree Classifier 
2. Logistic Classifier
3. KNN Classifiers
4 SVM Classifiers
5 Kernel SVM Classifiers
6 Naive Bayes Classifiers
7 Random Forest Classifiers

Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

##Dependencies

Anaconda (https://anaconda.org/)
Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
numpy (pip install numpy)
sklearn (pip install sklearn)
Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

python Gender_Classification.py

Credits for some of the code go to Siraj Raval
I've created classifiers for other classifications also, so that one can compare and start easily.
